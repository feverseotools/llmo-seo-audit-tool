nltk # Added for tokenization, stopwords

# Add these when you implement actual LLM calls:
# openai >= 1.0 # Use modern openai library version
# google-generativeai

# Consider adding these for more advanced processing:
# spacy
# readability-lxml
# textstat # For readability scores
# python-dotenv # If loading secrets locally outside streamlit

# Note: After installing nltk, you may need to download data packages.
# Run python and then:
# >>> import nltk
# >>> nltk.download('punkt')
# >>> nltk.download('stopwords')
# >>> nltk.download('vader_lexicon') # VADER lexicon (or it might download on first use)
```

Remember to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install these libraries and follow the instructions in the comments to download the necessary NLTK data packag
